  Bed types are not sequences of simple numbers.  WindowSweep::sweep() can
  be used with both types, but there are inherent difficulties with BED.

  Take, for instance, the properly ordered coordinates:
  Problem 1:
  chr1 0 100
  chr1 23 25
  chr1 23 107
  chr1 30 45
  chr1 31 32
  chr1 99 100
  chr1 101 107

  When the first element is evaluated, everything but the last row is part
  of the current window.  When you change to the second row, chr1 99 100 is
  no longer part of the current window.  Then it is for the 3rd row, then
  not for the 4th.  We do not account for such possibilities within sweep()
  or the main Visitor baseclass via events.

  BedBaseVisitor implements logic to deal with these problems, and issues
  events to subclasses appropriately.  Bed type visitors should inherit
  from BedBaseVisitor and use its public interface.

  The same sort of issue exists on the left end.
  Problem 2:
  chr1 0 100
  chr1 23 25
  chr1 39 100

  When the 3rd row is the current item, row 2 does not make up its window,
  but row 1 does.  Once row 2 is behind and out of scope relative to the
  current item; it never comes back into play.

  I believe memory management can no longer be passed down to derived classes
  due to buffering that goes on within this class.  I haven't thought about
  it much yet as no Visitor has yet needed its own memory management.

  I have tried optimizing things when the overlap method is based upon bp's and
   not percentages and received much better runtimes.  Unfortunately, my assumptions
   were wrong.  The bottom line is that you need to look at every element in the
   current window, both going out of range to the left and coming into range on
   the right in fixWindow().  Here is the case that fails:

  chr1  1   200  a  1
  chr1  10  20   b  3
  chr1  50  150  c  4

  when used with bedmap --bp-ovr 11 --count -

  row 2 has no hits, but row 1 goes with row 3's output.  Cannot assume that once
    row 2 is out of range that everything to the left of it is out of range too,
    even when looking at straight bp's.  The main issue shown here is that the
    --bp-ovr 11 is larger than row 2's range.  It can never qualify but row 1 can.

  All of the problems mentioned can be attributed to fully nested elements.  There
    are scenarios without fully nested elements that are problematic too without this
    BedBaseVisitor.  For example, consider using Visitors.hpp as base class with the
    bedmap application under the following scenario:
      bedmap --fraction-map 0.1 --echo --count with the following file:

        chr1	564622	564633
        chr1	564629	564637
        chr1	564634	564677
        chr1	564673	564681
        chr1	564974	565006
        chr1	564978	565023
        chr1	565007	565040
        chr1	565256	565294

   When at line 2, line 3 does not map b/c 0.1*43nt = 4nt while line 2 and line 3
     overlap by 3 nt.  But, when we go to line 3 as the reference, line 2 is an
     overlapping element that qualifies since its size is 8 nt (0.1*8nt -> any
     overlap satisfies).  Unfortunately, sweep() has already flushed out line 2
     since it has the inherent symmetry assumption:  dist(a,b) == dist(b,a).
   BedBaseVisitor deals with this scenario properly.

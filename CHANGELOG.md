# Previous versions

## v2.4.41

Released: **July 13, 2022**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched [issue 267](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/267)
        to remove unneeded `const` property from member functions, where
        it caused compilation problems with newer versions of Clang
        toolkit. Thanks to John Marshall and Shane Neph for feedback.
-   `closest-features <closest-features>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--no-query` option to suppress printing \"left\" or
        \"right\" (or both) query regions to output. When combined with
        `--no-refs` the output will report raw distance values.
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched `gtf2bed` and `gtf2starch` wrapper scripts to support
        `--attribute-key=foo` option, which previously only worked with
        `convert2bed --input=gtf --attribute-key=foo`.
    -   Addressed [issue
        255](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/255) by printing a
        warning to standard error, which suggests using `--max-mem` and
        `--sort-tmpdir`, or `--do-not-sort`, to manage post-conversion
        sort order for inputs larger than half of system memory.
    -   Addressed [issue
        239](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/239) by printing a
        warning to standard error, which suggests using
        `--multisplit=...` if Wiggle input contains multiple sections.
    -   Modified CIGAR string output of `bam2*` and `sam2*` conversion
        when used with the `--split` option, addressing [issue
        268](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/268). Thanks to
        Lalit Mudgal for the bug report.
-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolved [issue
        265](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/265) leading to
        overflow and early failure in sorting inputs with more than
        `MAX_INT` per-chromosome lines.
-   General
    -   Updated Ubuntu `main.yaml` test run on to `ubuntu-latest` image.
        Thanks to John Marshall for the advice.
    -   Modified `symlink_*` targets in `Makefile` to cull `xargs`
        warnings on Linux hosts. Thanks to Shane Neph for the report and
        fix.
    -   Removed C++11-deprecated calls to `binary_function<>` from
        utility library. Thanks to Shane Neph for the report and fix.
    -   Modified `switch-BEDOPS-binary-type` helper script to cull
        useless error messages.

## v2.4.40

Released: **July 21, 2021**

-   General
    -   Migrated from Travis CI to Github Actions for CI testing. Refer
        to
        [main.yml](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/actions/workflows/main.yml)
        for build logs.
    -   Modified Linux and Darwin makefiles to allow user-specified
        build flags ([CXXFLAGS]{.title-ref} and [CFLAGS]{.title-ref}) in
        conjunction with our preset values. Resolves [issue
        242](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/242) for OS X and
        Linux targets.
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolved [issue
        253](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/253) preventing
        conversion of Wiggle-formatted data that use non-UCSC chromosome
        naming scheme.
    -   Modified [wig2bed]{.title-ref} start and end shift arithmetic to
        ensure conversion from 1-based, fully-closed indexing to
        0-based, half-open indexing.
    -   Added [wig2bed]{.title-ref} integration tests. See
        [tests/conversion/Makefile]{.title-ref} and
        [wig2bed\_\*]{.title-ref} targets for more detail.
    -   In resolution of [issue
        244](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/244) the `gtf2bed`
        and `gff2bed` conversion scripts now support copying a subset of
        reserved attributes to the ID field by keyname. By default,
        `gtf2bed` and `gff2bed` will parse the attributes string and
        copy the `gene_id` value to the output ID field (i.e., fourth
        column). The `--attribute-key` option can be used to copy over
        `gene_name`, `transcript_name`, and several other attributes.
        See `gtf2bed --help`, `gff2bed --help`, or the online
        documentation for more information.
    -   Documentation updates for `gtf2bed` and `gff2bed`.
    -   Sample input updated for `gtf2bed` and `gff2bed` online
        documentation to resolve [issue
        240](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/240).
    -   Conversion of GTF to BED would fail with an error where one of
        either the `gene_id` or `transcript_id` attribute is missing,
        such as in Ensembl-sourced GTF. This behavior has been changed
        to a warning.
    -   Application parameters that require strings are checked for
        `NULL` string values, returning with an error when a required
        parameter is missing. Resolves [issue
        256](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/256) and more
        generally for other options.
-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched metadata generation function to resolve [issue
        248](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/248), where the
        chromosome name would previously be truncated on a period
        character when creating a Starch archive.
-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched C++11-deprecated calls to `std::mem_fun` and
        `std::bind2nd` in `MultiVisitor.hpp` and
        `MedianAbsoluteDeviationVisitor.hpp` visitors to reduce
        compile-time warnings and improve C++11 compatibility.

## v2.4.39

Released: **April 6, 2020**

-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched `--unique` to report output identical to `sort -u`, in
        order to resolve [Issue
        236](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/236).
-   `unstarch <unstarch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched `--is-starch` test option to read only up to, at most,
        8kb to check for v2 or v1 (legacy) Starch archive data, to
        resolve [Issue
        209](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/209).
-   General
    -   Updated main `Makefile` to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) GNU
        `coreutils` and `findutils` tools on the OS X target. If you
        build BEDOPS on OS X, you can add these tools with
        `brew install coreutils findutils`.

## v2.4.38

Released: **March 31, 2020**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched segmentation fault in malformed RepeatMasker input
        conversion. Thanks to [Mark
        Diekhans](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/235) for the
        bug report.
    -   Patched abort and segmentation faults in malformed GVF, GFF,
        GTF, and WIG input conversion. Thanks to [Hongxu
        Chen](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/217) for the bug
        report.
    -   Patched documentation and help message for BAM and SAM
        conversion. Thanks to [Zhuoer
        Dong](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/215) for the
        report.
    -   Patched GTF conversion test suite.
-   General
    -   Updated outdated date information.

## v2.4.37

Released: **October 11, 2019**

-   `starchcat <starchcat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   A bug was introduced in v2.4.36 that would cause segmentation
        faults when concatenating disjoint Starch files, which is fixed
        in this version. Thanks to Eric Rynes for the bug report.
    -   Added a unit test to `tests/starch` to test this particular
        issue.
-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Running `bedmap --version` now exits with a zero
        (non-error/success) status.
-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   When a Starch file with a header is provided as input to
        `bedops` or `bedmap`, the line is errantly processed as a BED
        interval. Thanks to [Andr√© M.
        Ribeiro-dos-Santos](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/pull/229)
        for patching the Starch C++ API to skip headers.
    -   Added a unit test to `tests/starch` to test headered Starch
        mapped against itself.
-   General
    -   Applied a placeholder workaround to whatever stupid bug was
        introducted in [Issue
        5709](https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/5709)
        that broke image serving for the document index (front page).
    -   Improved speed of generating random intervals in `tests/starch`
        unit tests.

## v2.4.36

Released: **May 2, 2019**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolved an issue preventing use of a `bash` process
        substitution or Unix named pipe in the reference position:
        *i.e.*,
        `bedmap --options <(processToGenerateReferenceElements) map.bed`
        and similar would issue incorrect output. Thanks to Wouter
        Meuleman and others for reports and test input.
    -   To avoid mapping problems, map elements should not contain
        spaces in the ID or subsequent non-interval fields. Use of the
        `--ec` can help identify problems in map input, at the cost of a
        longer runtime. The documentation is clarified to warn users
        about avoiding spaces in map input. Thanks to Wouter Meuleman
        for the report and providing test input.
    -   Added `--unmapped-val <val>` option, where `<val>` replaces the
        empty string output of `--echo-map*` operations when there are
        no mapped elements. The `--min/max-element` operators will give
        results as before (the empty string).
-   General
    -   Reduced
        `warning: zero as null pointer constant [-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant]`
        compiler warnings via Clang.
    -   Begun work on a comprehensive test suite for BEDOPS
        applications. Tests are available via source distribution in
        `${root}/tests` and can be run by entering `make` in this
        directory.

## v2.4.35

Released: **May 2, 2018**

-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   When compressing records, if the last interval in the former
        chromosome is identical to the first interval of the next
        chromosome, then a test on the sort order of the remainder
        string of that interval is applied (incorrectly). This is
        patched to test that chromosome names are identical before
        applying sort order rules. Thanks to Andrew Nishida for the
        report and for providing test input.

## v2.4.34

Released: **April 26, 2018**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   In [Issue 208](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/208)
        builds of `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} would exit with an error state when converting SAM
        input with newline-delimited records longer than the 5 MB
        per-thread I/O buffer. The `C2B_THREAD_IO_BUFFER_SIZE` constant
        is now set to the suite-wide `TOKENS_MAX_LENGTH` value, which
        should make it easier to compile custom builds of BEDOPS that
        support very-long line lengths. Thanks to Erich Schwarz for the
        initial report.
-   `starchstrip <starchstrip>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   When [starchstrip]{.title-ref} is compiled with a C compiler,
        `qsort` uses a comparator that works correctly on the input
        chromosome list. When compiled with a C++ compiler (such as when
        building the larger BEDOPS toolkit), a different comparator is
        used that does not make variables of the correct type, and so
        the `qsort` result is garbage, leading to missing chromosomes.
        Thanks to Jemma Nelson for the initial report.

## v2.4.33

Released: **April 9, 2018**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolved [Issue
        207](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/207) where a
        megarow build of `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} would raise segmentation faults when converting SAM
        input. This build uses constants that define a longer BED line
        length. Arrays ended up using more stack than available,
        resulting in segmentation faults. This issue could potentially
        affect conversion of any data with the megarow build of
        `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
        Arrays using megarow-constants were replaced with heap- or
        dynamically-allocated pointers. Thanks to Erich Schwarz for the
        initial report.

## v2.4.32

Released: **March 14, 2018**

-   New build type (128-bit precision floating point arithmetic,
    `float128`)
    -   A new build type adds support for `long double` or 128-bit
        floating point operations on measurement values in
        `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, such as is used
        with score operators like: `--min`, `--max`, `--min-element`,
        `--max-element`, `--mean`, and so on.
    -   This build includes support for measurements on values ranging
        from approximately ¬± 6.48e‚àí4966 to ¬± 6.48e4966
        ([subnormal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denormal_number)), or
        ¬± 1.19e-4932 to ¬± 1.19e4932 (normal), which enables
        `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to handle, for
        example, lower p-values without log- or other transformation
        preprocessing steps. The article on [quadruple
        precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadruple-precision_floating-point_format)
        can be useful for technical review.
    -   For comparison, the current \"non-float128\" typical and megarow
        builds allow measurements on values from approximately ¬± 5e‚àí324
        to ¬± 5e324 (subnormal) or ¬± 2.23e-308 to ¬± 2.23e308 (normal).
        Please refer to the article on [double
        precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)
        for more technical detail.
    -   Please use `make float128 && make install_float128` to install
        this build type.
    -   This build type combines support for quadruple, 128-bit
        precision floats with the `typical` build type for handling
        \"typical\" BED4+ style line lengths. At this time, \"megarow\"
        support is not enabled with higher precision floats.
    -   This build will use more memory to store floating-point values
        with higher precision, and processing those data will require
        more computation time. It is recommended that this build be used
        only if analyses require a higher level of precision than what
        the `double` type allows.
-   OS X (Darwin) megarow build
    -   Some applications packaged in the OS X installer or compiled via
        the OS X command-line developer toolkit lacked
        [megarow](http://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/revision-history.html#v2-4-27)
        build support, despite those flags being specified in the parent
        Makefile. These applications specifically were affected:
        `bedextract`, `bedmap`, and `convert2bed`. These binaries rely
        on wider suite-wide constants and data types that the megarow
        build variety specifies. The Darwin-specific Makefiles have been
        fixed to resolve this build issue, so that all OS X BEDOPS
        binaries should now be able to compile in the correct
        megarow-specific settings.

## v2.4.31

Released: **March 8, 2018**

-   User forum
    -   BEDOPS user forum moved domains from <http://bedops.stamlab.org>
        to <https://bedops.altius.org>
    -   Testing out administrator approval requirement for new forum
        accounts, to help try to reduce visits from spammers.
-   Documentation
    -   Updated Homebrew installation instructions per [issue
        202](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/202) (thanks to
        user EricFromCanada).
-   `wig2bed <wig2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Increased maximum length of chromosome name buffer to suite-wide
        `TOKEN_CHR_MAX_LENGTH` value, to reduce likelihood of
        segmentation faults (thanks to user ma-diroma).
-   General
    -   Updated copyright dates in source and headers.

## v2.4.30

Released: **November 25, 2017**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Errors are no longer reported when error checking is enabled and
        running in non-fast mode, when a fully-nested element is
        detected. This follows up on [issue
        199](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/199).
-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Previously, a chromosome record in a Starch archive would result
        in corrupted metadata, if the chromosome is larger than
        `UINT32_MAX` bytes (\~4.3GB) in size when compressed. This
        limitation is now removed, and a single chromosome (when
        compressed in a Starch archive) can be up to `UINT64_MAX` bytes
        in size.
    -   The `starch` binary does more stringent input checks for the
        character lengths of ID and remainder strings, which must be no
        larger than 2^ID_EXPONENT^ - 1 and 2^REST_EXPONENT^ - 1
        characters in length. (These constants are specific to the
        build-time settings in the Makefile and in the app-wide
        constants.) This follows up on [issue
        195](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/195).
-   `starchcat <starchcat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Previously, a chromosome record in a Starch archive would result
        in corrupted metadata, if the chromosome is larger than
        `UINT32_MAX` bytes (\~4.3GB) in size when compressed. This
        limitation is now removed, and a single chromosome (when
        compressed in a Starch archive) can be up to `UINT64_MAX` bytes
        in size.
    -   More stringent memory management and stricter adherance to
        BEDOPS-wide constants, to help reduce likelihood of pointer
        access out of bounds and incidence of segfaults.
-   `unstarch <unstarch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   The `unstarch` binary implements the character length constants
        of ID and remainder strings, specific to the build-time settings
        in the Makefile and in the app-wide constants. This follows up
        on [issue 195](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/195).
-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--unique` (`-u`) and `--duplicates` (`-d`) options to
        only print unique and duplicate in sorted output, to mimic the
        behavior of `sort -u` and `uniq -d` Unix tools. This follows up
        on [issue 196](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/196).
    -   Switched compile-time, stack-allocated `char` arrays to runtime,
        heap-based pointers. Timing tests on shuffled FIMO datasets
        suggest the impact from having to allocate space for buffers at
        runtime is very minimal. Moving from stack to heap will help
        avoid segfaults from running into OS-level stack limits, when
        BEDOPS-level constants change the maximum line length to
        something larger than the stack.
-   Revision testing
    -   Starch suite tests were updated for v2.2 archives created via
        v2.4.30 binaries (Linux, libc 2.22).

## v2.4.29

Released: **September 26, 2017**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Increased megarow build ID length up to 2^18^.
    -   Changed behavior of mapping to return mapped items in sort order
        provided in inputs. This follows up on [issue
        198](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/198).
-   `unstarch <unstarch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Changed behavior of `--is-starch` option to always return a
        successful exit code of `0` whether or not the input file is a
        Starch archive. It will now be up to the person running this
        option to test the 0 (false) or 1 (true) value printed to the
        standard output stream. This follows up on [issue
        197](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/197).

## v2.4.28

Released: **August 18, 2017**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched [issue 191](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/191)
        where `--wmean` option was not recognized.
-   `bedextract <bedextract>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Updated documentation with fixed usage statement.
-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched typo in `update-sort-bed-starch-slurm.py` script.
    -   Fixed bug with `--max-mem` on properly ordering things on fourth
        and subsequent columns, when the genomic intervals are the same.
-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Updated Makefiles to remove [lib]{.title-ref} on
        [clean]{.title-ref} target and to help prevent `ARCH` variable
        from getting clobbered by third-party package managers.
-   Build process
    -   Updated the OS X installer XML to resolve missing asset links.
    -   Updated the `module_binaries` target to copy over
        `starchcluster_*` and `starch-diff` assets for `modules`

## v2.4.27

Released: **July 17, 2017**

This revision of BEDOPS includes significant performance improvements
for core tools: `bedops`, `bedmap`, and `closest-features`. Performance
tests were done with whole-genome TRANSFAC FIMO scans, with cache purges
in between trials.

Pre-built binaries for Darwin and GNU/Linux targets include both the
default `typical` and `megarow` builds of BEDOPS. The program names that
you are accustomed to will remain as-is, but the binaries will exist as
symbolic links pointing to the `typical` builds. These links can be
repointed to the `megarow` builds by calling
`switch-BEDOPS-binary-type --megarow`, which will set the usual BEDOPS
binaries to link to the `megarow` builds. One can run
`switch-BEDOPS-binary-type --typical` at any time to revert to the
default (`typical`) builds.

The top-level Makefile includes some new variables for those who choose
to build from source. The `JPARALLEL` variable sets the number of CPUs
to use in parallel when compiling BEDOPS, which can speed compilation
time dramatically. The `MASSIVE_REST_EXP`, `MASSIVE_ID_EXP`, and
`MASSIVE_CHROM_EXP` are used when building the `megarow` to support any
required row lengths (build using `make megarow`). These are the
exponents (the *n* in 2^n^) for holding all characters after chromosome,
start, and stop fields, the ID field (column 4, typically), and the
chromosome field (column 1).

To simplify distribution and support, we have removed pre-built 32-bit
program versions in this release. These can be built from source by
specifying the correct `ARCH` value in the top-level Makefile. For OS X,
our package installer now requires OS X version 10.10 or greater.

Application-level notes follow:

-   `bedops <bedops>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   Performance of `bedops` tool improved, doing typical work in
        **76.5%** of the time of all previous versions.
    -   Performance of `-u`/`--everything` has improved, doing the same
        work in only **55.6%** of the time of previous versions when
        given a large number of input files.
    -   The `megarow` build of this application handles input files with
        very long rows (4M+ characters). Such input might arise from
        conversion of very-long-read BAM files to BED via `bam2bed`,
        such as those that may come from Nanopore or PacBio MinION
        platforms. This build requires more runtime memory than the
        default (`typical`) build. Pertinent variables for `megarow`
        execution can be modified through the make system without
        changing source.

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   Performance of `bedmap` tool improved, doing the same work in
        **86.7%** of the time of all previous versions.
    -   Automatically use `--faster` option when `--exact` is used as
        the overlap criterion, or if the input files are formatted as
        Starch archives, no fully-nested elements exist in the archives,
        and the overlap criterion supports `--faster` (such as
        `--bp-ovr`, `--exact`, and `--range`).
    -   The `megarow` build target handles input files with very long
        rows (4M+ characters). Such input might arise from conversion of
        very-long-read BAM files to BED via `bam2bed`, such as those
        that may come from Nanopore or PacBio MinION platforms. This
        build requires more runtime memory than the default (`typical`)
        build. Pertinent variables for `megarow` execution can be
        modified through the make system without changing source.
    -   New `--min-memory` option for use when the reference file has
        very large regions, and the map file has many small regions that
        fall within those larger regions. One example is when
        `--range 100000` is used and the map file consists of
        whole-genome motif scan hits. Memory overhead can be reduced to
        that used by all previous versions, up to and including v2.4.26.
    -   Added `--faster` automatically when `--exact` is used, which is
        robust even when nested elements exist in inputs. Similarly,
        `--faster` is used automatically when inputs are
        Starch-formatted archives, none of which have nested elements
        (see `unstarch --has-nested`) when the overlap criterion allows
        for `--faster`.

-   `closest-features <closest-features>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   Performance of `closest-features` tool has been improved, doing
        the same work in **87.7%** of the time of all previous versions.
    -   The `megarow` build target is available to compile a version of
        the program that can handle input files with very long rows (4M+
        characters). This requires more runtime memory than the default
        build. Pertinent variables can be modified through the make
        system without editing source.

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    Numerous internal changes, including giving line functors the
    ability to resize the destination (write) buffer in mid-stream,
    along with increased integration with BEDOPS-wide constants.
    Destination buffer resizing is particularly useful when converting
    very-long-read BAM files containing numerous D (deletion)
    operations, such as when used with the new `--split-with-deletions`
    option.

    -   `psl2bed <psl2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Migrated storage of PSL conversion state from stack to heap,
            which helps address segmentation faults on OS X (thanks to
            <rmartson@Biostars> for the bug report).
    -   `bam2bed <bam2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
        `sam2bed <sam2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Increased thread I/O heap buffer size to reduce likelihood
            of overflows while parsing reads from Nanopore and PacBio
            platforms.
        -   Added `--split-with-deletions` option to split spliced
            junctions by `N` and `D` CIGAR operations. The `--split`
            option now splits only on `N` operations.
        -   Added `--reduced` option to print first six columns of BED
            data to standard output.
    -   `gff2bed <gff2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Resolved issue parsing GFF input with `##FASTA` directive.

-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   The `megarow` build target is available to compile a version of
        the program that can handle input files with very long rows (4M+
        characters). This requires more runtime memory than the default
        build. The pertinent variables can be modified through the make
        system without changing source. This is useful for converting
        ultra-long reads from Nanopore and PacBio sequencing platforms
        to BED via `bam2bed` / `convert2bed`.

-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   Fixed a potential segmentation fault result with `--header`
        usage.

-   Starch C++ API

    -   Fixed output from `bedops -u` (`--everything`, or multiset
        union) on two or more Starch archives, where the remainder
        string was not being cleared correctly.

-   `starch-diff <starch_diff>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   Improved usage statement to clarify output (cf. [Issue
        180](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/180)).

-   Clang warnings

    -   Resolved compilation warnings for several binaries.

## v2.4.26

Released: **March 14, 2017**

-   `starchstrip <starchstrip>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   New utility to efficiently filter a Starch archive, including or
        excluding records by specified chromosome names, without doing
        expensive extraction and recompression. This follows up on
        [internal
        discussion](https://stamlab.slack.com/archives/bedops/p1487878245000103)
        on the Altius Slack channel.
-   `starch-diff <starch_diff>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed testing logic in `starch-diff` for certain archives.
        Thanks to Shane Neph for the report.
-   `starchcat <starchcat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed possible condition where too many variables on the stack
        can cause a stack overload on some platforms, leading to a fatal
        segmentation fault. Improved logic for updating v2.1 to v2.2
        Starch archives.
-   Starch C++ API
    -   Patched gzip-backed Starch archive extraction issue. Thanks to
        Matt Maurano for the bug report.
-   `update-sort-bed-migrate-candidates <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   Added detailed logging via `--debug` option.
    -   Added `--bedops-root-dir` option to allow specifying where all
        BEDOPS binaries are stored. This setting can be overruled on a
        per-binary basis by adding `--bedextract-path`,
        `--sort-bed-path`, etc.
    -   Added `--non-recursive-search` option to restrict search for BED
        and Starch candidates to the top-level of the specified parent
        directory `--parent-dir` option.
    -   Further simplification and customization of parameters sent to
        `update-sort-bed-slurm` and `update-sort-bed-starch-slurm`
        cluster scripts, as well as logging and variable name
        improvements to those two scripts.
    -   Thanks again to Matt Maurano for ongoing feedback and
        suggestions on functionality and fixes.
-   `gtf2bed <gtf2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolved segmentation fault with certain inputs, in follow-up to
        [this BEDOPS Forum
        post](http://bedops.uwencode.org/forum/index.php?topic=136.0).
        Thanks to zebasilio for the report and feedback.

## v2.4.25

Released: **February 15, 2017**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}

    -   Patch for RepeatMasker inputs with blank lines that have no
        spaces. This follows up on [Issue
        173](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/173). Thanks to
        saketkc for the bug report.

-   `update-sort-bed-migrate-candidates <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

    The `update-sort-bed-migrate-candidates` utility recursively
    searches into the specified directory for BED and Starch files which
    fail a `sort-bed --check-sort` test. Those files which fail this
    test can have their paths written to a text file for further
    downstream processing, or the end user can decide to apply an
    immediate resort on those files, either locally or via a
    SLURM-managed cluster. Grateful thanks to Matt Maurano for input and
    testing.

    See `update-sort-bed-migrate-candidates --help` for more
    information, or review the `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} documentation.

-   `update-sort-bed-starch-slurm <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}

    This is an adjunct to the `update-sort-bed-slurm` utility, which
    resorts the provided Starch file and writes a new file. (The
    `update-sort-bed-slurm` utility only takes in BED files as input and
    writes BED as output.)

## v2.4.24

Released: **February 6, 2017**

-   `starch-diff <starch_diff>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   The `starch-diff` utility compares signatures of two or more
        v2.2+ Starch archives. This tool tests all chromosomes or one
        specified chromosome. It returns a zero exit code, if the
        signature(s) are identical, or a non-zero error exit code, if
        one or more signature(s) are dissimilar.
-   `update-sort-bed-slurm <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   The `update-sort-bed-slurm` convenience utility provides a
        parallelized update of the sort order on BED files sorted with
        pre-v2.4.20 sort-bed, for users with a SLURM job scheduler and
        associated cluster. See `update-sort-bed-slurm --help` for more
        details.
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Patched a memory leak in VCF conversion. Thanks to ehsueh for
        the bug report.

## v2.4.23

Released: **January 30, 2017**

-   `unstarch <unstarch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed bug where missing signature from pre-v2.2 Starch archives
        would cause a fatal metadata error. Thanks to Shane Neph and
        Eric Rynes for the bug report.
    -   Improved logic reporting signature mismatches when input v2.2
        archive lacks signature (*e.g.*, for a v2.2 archive made with
        `--omit-signature`).
-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    `starchcat <starchcat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--omit-signature` option to compress without creating a
        per-chromosome data integrity signature. While this reduces
        compression time, this eliminates the verification benefits of
        the data integrity signature.

## v2.4.22

Released: **January 25, 2017**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed heap corruption in GFF conversion. Thanks to J. Miguel
        Mendez (ObjectiveTruth) for the bug report.

## v2.4.21

Released: **January 23, 2017**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   New `--wmean` operation offers a weighted mean calculation. The
        \"weight\" is derived from the proportion of the reference
        element covered by overlapping map elements: *i.e.*, a map
        element that covers more of the reference element has its signal
        given a larger weight or greater impact than another map element
        with a shorter overlap.
    -   Measurement values in `bedmap` did not allow `+` in the exponent
        (both `-` worked and no `+` for a positive value. Similarly, out
        in front of the number, `+` was previously not allowed. Shane
        Neph posted the report and the fix.
    -   The `--min-element` and `--max-element` operations in
        `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} now process
        elements in unambiguous order. Former behavior is moved to the
        operations `--min-element-rand` and `--max-element-rand`,
        respectively.
    -   Fixed issue with use of `--echo-overlap-size` with
        `--multidelim` (cf. [Issue
        165](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/165)). Shane Neph
        posted the fix. Thanks to Jeff Vierstra for the bug report!
-   `bedops <bedops>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed issue with `--chop` where complement operation could
        potentially be included. Shane Neph posted the fix.
    -   The `bedops --everything` or `bedops -u` (union) operation now
        writes elements to standard output in unambiguous sort order. If
        any data are contained in fourth or subsequent fields, a
        lexicographical sort on that data is applied for resolving order
        of interval matches.
-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Improved sort times from replacing quicksort (`std::qsort`) with
        inlined C++ `std::sort`.

    -   Sorting of BED input now leads to unambiguous result when two or
        more elements have the same genomic interval (chromosome name
        and start and stop position), but different content in remaining
        columns (ID, score, etc.).

        Formerly, elements with the same genomic interval that have
        different content in fourth and subsequent columns could be
        printed in a non-consistent ordering on repeated sorts. A
        deterministic sort order facilitates the use of data integrity
        functions on sorted BED and Starch data.
-   `starchcluster <starchcluster>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   A SLURM-ready version of the `starchcluster` script was added to
        help SLURM job scheduler users with parallelizing the creation
        of Starch archives.
-   Parallel `bam2bed <parallel_bam2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    and `bam2starch <parallel_bam2starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   SLURM-ready versions of these scripts were added to help
        parallelize the conversion of BAM to BED files (`bam2bed_slurm`)
        or to Starch archives (`bam2starch_slurm`).
-   `unstarch <unstarch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--signature` option to report the Base64-encoded SHA-1
        data integrity signature of the Starch-transformed bytes of a
        specified chromosome, or to report the signature of the metadata
        string as well as the signatures of all chromosomes, if
        unspecified.

    -   Added `--verify-signature` option to compare the \"expected\"
        Base64-encoded SHA-1 data integrity signature stored within the
        archive\'s metadata with the \"observed\" data integrity
        signature generated from extracting the specified chromosome.

        If the observed and expected signatures differ, then this
        suggests that the chromosome record may be corrupted in some
        way; `unstarch` will exit with a non-zero error code. If the
        signatures agree, the archive data should be intact and
        [unstarch]{.title-ref} will exit with a helpful notice and a
        zero error code.

        If no chromosome is specified, `unstarch` will loop through all
        chromosomes in the archive metadata, comparing observed and
        expected values for each chromosome record. Upon completion,
        error and progress messages will be reported to the standard
        error stream, and `unstarch` will exit with a zero error code,
        if all signatures match, or a non-zero exit state, if one or
        more signatures do not agree.

    -   The output from the `--list` option includes a `signature`
        column to report the data integrity signature of all
        Starch-transformed chromosome data.

    -   The output from the `--list-json` option includes a `signature`
        key in each chromosome record in the archive metadata, reporting
        the same information.

    -   The `--is-starch` option now quits with a non-zero exit code, if
        the specified input file is not a Starch archive.

    -   The `--elements-max-string-length` option reports the length of
        the longest string within the specified chromosome, or the
        longest string over all chromosomes (if no chromosome name is
        specified).
-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--report-progress=N` option to (optionally) report
        compression of the Nth element of the current chromosome to
        standard error stream.

    -   As a chromosome is compressed, the input Starch-transform bytes
        are continually run through a SHA-1 hash function. The resulting
        data integrity signature is stored as a Base64-encoded string in
        the output archive\'s metadata. Signatures can be compared
        between and within archives to help better ensure the data
        integrity of the archive.

    -   Fixed `--header` transform bug reported in [Issue
        161](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/161). Thanks to
        Shane Neph for the bug report!

    -   Added chromosome name and \"remainder\" order tests to
        `STARCH2_transformHeaderlessBEDInput` and
        `STARCH2_transformHeaderedBEDInput` functions.

        Compression with `starch` ends with a fatal error, should any of
        the following comparison tests fail:

        1.  The chromosome names are not lexicographically ordered
            (*e.g.*, `chr1` records coming after `chr2` records
            indicates the data are not correctly sorted).
        2.  The start position of an input element is less than the
            start position of a previous input element on the same
            chromosome (*e.g.*, `chr1:1000-1234` coming after
            `chr1:2000-2345` is not correctly sorted).
        3.  The stop positions of two or more input elements are not in
            ascending order when their start positions are equal
            (*e.g.*, `chr1:1000-1234` coming after `chr1:1000-2345` is
            not correctly sorted).
        4.  The start and stop positions of two or more input elements
            are equivalent, and their \"remainders\" (fourth and
            subsequent columns) are not in ascending order (*e.g.*,
            `chr1:1000-1234:id-0` coming after `chr1:1000-1234:id-1` is
            not correctly sorted).

        If the sort order of the input data is unknown or uncertain,
        simply use `sort-bed` to generate the correct ordering and pipe
        the output from that to `starch`, *e.g.*
        `$ cat elements.bed | sort-bed - | starch - > elements.starch`.
-   `starchcat <starchcat>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--report-progress=N` option to (optionally) report
        compression of the *N* th element of the current chromosome to
        standard error stream.
    -   As in `starch`, at the conclusion of compressing a chromosome
        made from one or more input Starch archives, the input
        Starch-transform bytes are continually run through a SHA-1 hash
        function. The resulting data integrity signature is stored as a
        Base64-encoded string in the chromosome\'s entry in the new
        archive\'s metadata.
    -   As in `starch`, if data should need to be extracted and
        recompressed, the output is written so that the order is
        unambiguous: ascending lexicographic ordering on chromosome
        names, numerical ordering on start positions, the same ordering
        on stop positions where start positions match, and ascending
        lexicographic ordering on the remainder of the BED element
        (fourth and subsequent columns, where present).
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Improvements in support for BAM/SAM inputs with larger-sized
        reads, as would come from alignments made from data collected
        from third-generation sequencers. Simulated read datasets were
        generated using
        [SimLoRD](https://bitbucket.org/genomeinformatics/simlord/).
        Tests have been performed on simulated hg19 data up to 100kb
        read lengths.

        Improvements allow:

        -   conversion of dynamic number of CIGAR operations (up to
            system memory)
        -   conversion of dynamically-sized read fields (up to system
            memory and inter-thread buffer allocations)

        These patches follow up on bug reports in [Issue
        157](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/157).

    -   Improvements in support for VCF inputs, to allow aribtrary-sized
        fields (up to system memory and inter-thread buffer
        allocations), which should reduce or eliminate segmentation
        faults from buffer overruns on fields larger than former stack
        defaults.

    -   Improvements in support for GFF inputs, to allow aribtrary-sized
        fields (up to system memory and inter-thread buffer
        allocations), which should reduce or eliminate segmentation
        faults from buffer overruns on fields larger than former stack
        defaults.

    -   Improvements in support for GTF inputs, to allow aribtrary-sized
        fields (up to system memory and inter-thread buffer
        allocations), which should reduce or eliminate segmentation
        faults from buffer overruns on fields larger than former stack
        defaults.
-   Testing
    -   Our use of Travis CI to automate testing of builds now includes
        Clang on [their OS X
        environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/osx-ci-environment/).

## v2.4.20

Released: **July 27, 2016**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Increased memory allocation for maximum number of per-read CIGAR
        operations in BAM and SAM conversion to help improve stability.
        Thanks to Adam Freedman for the report!
    -   Improved reliability of gene ID parsing from GTF input, where
        `gene_id` field may be positioned at start, middle, or end of
        attributes string, or may be empty. Thanks to blaiseli for the
        report!

        Feng Tian for reports.

## v2.4.16

Released: **April 5, 2016**

-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added new `--echo-ref-row-id` option to report reference row ID
        elements.
-   Starch C++ API

-   General improvements
    -   Small improvements to build cleanup targets.

## v2.4.15

Released: **January 21, 2016**

-   Docker container build target added for CentOS 7
    -   Thanks to Leo Comitale (Poldo) for writing a Makefile target and
        spec for creating a BEDOPS Docker container for CentOS 7.
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed buffer overflows in `convert2bed` to improve conversion
        reliability for VCF files (thanks to Jared Andrews and Kousik
        Kundu for bug reports).
-   General improvements
    -   Improved OS X 10.11 build process.

## v2.4.14

Released: **April 21, 2015**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed missing `samtools` variable references in cluster
        conversion scripts (thanks to Brad Gulko for the bug report).
-   General suite-wide improvements
    -   Fixed exception error message for `stdin` check (thanks to Brad
        Gulko for the bug report).

## v2.4.13

Released: **April 20, 2015**

-   `bedops <bedops>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolved issue in using `--ec` with `bedops` when reading from
        `stdin` (thanks to Brad Gulko for the bug report).
-   General suite-wide improvements
    -   Addressed inconsistency with constants defined for the suite at
        the extreme end of the limits we allow for coordinate values
        (thanks again to Brad Gulko for the report).

## v2.4.12

Released: **March 13, 2015**

-   `bedops <bedops>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Checks have been added to determine if an integer argument is a
        file in the current working directory, before interpreting that
        argument as an overlap criterion for `-e` and `-n` options.

        To reduce ambiguity, if an integer is used as a file input,
        `bedops` issues a warning of the interpretation and provides
        guidance on how to force that value to instead be used as an
        overlap specification, if desired (thanks to E. Rynes for the
        pointer).
-   `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added support for `--prec` / `--sci` with `--min-element` and
        `--max-element` operations (thanks to E. Rynes for the pointer).
-   `bedops <bedops>`{.interpreted-text role="REF"} \|
    `bedmap <bedmap>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} \|
    `closest-features <closest-features>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added support for `bash` process substitution/named pipes with
        specification of `--chrom` and/or `--ec` options (thanks to B.
        Gulko for the bug report).
    -   Fixed code that extracts `gzip`-backed Starch archives from
        `bedops` and other core tools (thanks again to B. Gulko for the
        bug report).
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Switched `matches` and `qSize` fields in order of `psl2bed`
        output. Refer to documentation for new field order.
    -   Added null sentinel to GTF ID value.
    -   To help reduce the chance of buffer overflows, the `convert2bed`
        tool increases the maximum field length from 8191 to 24575
        characters to allow parsing of inputs with longer field length,
        such as very long attributes from [mosquito
        GFF3](https://www.vectorbase.org/download/aedes-aegypti-liverpoolbasefeaturesaaegl33gff3gz)
        data (thanks to T. Karginov for the bug report).

## v2.4.11

Released: **February 24, 2015**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed bug in `psl2bed` where `matches` column value was
        truncated by one character. Updated unit tests. Thanks to M.
        Wirthlin for the bug report.

## v2.4.10

Released: **February 23, 2015**

-   `starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   In addition to checking chromosome interleaving, the `starch`
        tool now enforces `sort-bed` sort ordering on BED input and
        exits with an `EINVAL` POSIX error code if the data are not
        sorted correctly.
-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--zero-indexed` option to `wig2bed` and `wig2starch`
        wrappers and `convert2bed` binary, which converts WIG data that
        are zero-indexed without any coordinate adjustments. This is
        useful for WIG data sourced from the UCSC Kent tool
        `bigWigToWig`, where the `bigWig` data can potentially be
        sourced from 0-indexed BAM- or bedGraph-formatted data.
    -   If the WIG input contains any element with a start coordinate of
        0, the default use of `wig2bed`, `wig2starch` and `convert2bed`
        will exit early with an error condition, suggesting the use of
        `--zero-indexed`.
    -   Updated copyright date range of wrapper scripts

## v2.4.9

Released: **February 17, 2015**

-   `sort-bed <sort-bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added support for `--check-sort` to report if input is sorted
        (or not)
-   Starch
    -   Improved support for `starch --header`, where header contains
        tab-delimited fields
-   Starch C++ API
    -   Fixed bug with `starch --header` functionality, such that BEDOPS
        core tools (`bedops`, etc.) would be unable to extract correct
        data from headered Starch archive

## v2.4.8

Released: **February 7, 2015**

-   Mac OS X packaging
    -   Installer signed with
        [productsign](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/productsign.1.html#//apple_ref/doc/man/1/productsign)
        to pass [OS X
        Gatekeeper](http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491)
-   Linux packaging
    -   SHA1 hashes of each tarball are now part of the [BEDOPS
        Releases](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/releases/)
        description page, going forwards
-   Updated copyright dates in source code

## v2.4.7

Released: **February 2, 2015**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} fixes and
    improvements
    -   Fixed `--split` support in `psl2bed` (thanks to Marco A.)
    -   Fixed compilation warning regarding comparison of signed and
        unsigned values
    -   Fixed corrupted `psl2bed` test inputs

## v2.4.6

Released: **January 30, 2015**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} fixes and
    improvements
    -   Added support for conversion of the [GVF file
        format](http://www.sequenceontology.org/resources/gvf.html#summary),
        including wrapper scripts and unit tests. Refer to the `gvf2bed`
        documentation for more information.
    -   Fixed bug in string copy of zero-length element attribute for
        `gff2bed` and `gtf2bed` (GFF and GTF) formats
-   General fixes and improvements
    -   Fixed possibly corrupt bzip2, Jansson and zlib tarballs (thanks
        to rekado, Shane N. and Richard S.)
    -   Fixed typo in `bedextract` documentation
    -   Fixed broken image in `Overview <overview>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"}
    -   Removed 19 MB `_build` intermediate result directory (which
        should improve overall `git clone` time considerably!)

## v2.4.5

Released: **January 28, 2015**

-   `convert2bed <convert2bed>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    improvements
    -   Addition of RepeatMasker annotation output (`.out`) file
        conversion support, `rmsk2bed` and `rmsk2starch` wrappers, and
        unit tests

## v2.4.4

Released: **January 25, 2015**

-   Documentation improvements
    -   Implemented substantial style changes via [A Better Sphinx
        Theme](http://github.com/irskep/sphinx-better-theme) and various
        customizations. We also include responsive web style elements to
        help improve browsing on mobile devices.
    -   Fixes to typos in conversion and other documents.

## v2.4.3

Released: **December 18, 2014**

-   Compilation improvements
    -   Shane Neph put in a great deal of work to enable parallel builds
        (*e.g.*, `make -j N` to build various targets in parallel).
        Depending on the end user\'s environment, this can speed up
        compilation time by a factor of 2, 4 or more.
    -   Fixed numerous compilation warnings of debug builds of `starch`
        toolkit under RHEL6/GCC and OS X 10.10.1/LLVM.
-   New `bedops`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} features
    -   Added `--chop` and `--stagger` options to \"melt\" inputs into
        contiguous or staggered disjoint regions of equivalent size.
    -   For less confusion, arguments for `--element-of`, `--chop` and
        other `bedops` operations that take numerical modifiers no
        longer require a leading hyphen character. For instance,
        `--element-of 1` is now equivalent to the former usage of
        `--element-of -1`.
-   New `bedmap`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} features
    -   The `--sweep-all` option reads through the entire map file
        without early termination and can help deal with `SIGPIPE`
        errors. It adds to execution time, but the penalty is not as
        severe as with the use of `--ec`. Using `--ec` alone will enable
        error checking, but will now no longer read through the entire
        map file. The `--ec` option can be used in conjunction with
        `--sweep-all`, with the associated time penalties. (Another
        method for dealing with issue this is to override how `SIGPIPE`
        errors are caught by the interpreter (`bash`, Python, *etc.*)
        and retrapping them or ignoring them. However, it may not a good
        idea to do this as other situations may arise in production
        pipelines where it is ideal to trap and handle all I/O errors in
        a default manner.)
    -   New `--echo-ref-size` and `--echo-ref-name` operations report
        genomic length of reference element, and rename the reference
        element in `chrom:start-end` (useful for labeling rows for input
        for `matrix2png` or `R` or other applications).
-   `bedextract`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed upper bound bug that would cause incorrect output in some
        cases
-   `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   Brand new C99 binary called `convert2bed`, which wrapper scripts
        (`bam2bed`, *etc.*) now call. No more Python version
        dependencies, and the C-based rewrite offers massive performance
        improvements over old Python-based scripts.
    -   Added `parallel_bam2starch` script, which parallelizes creation
        of `Starch <starch_specification>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        archive from very large BAM files in SGE environments.
    -   Added bug fix for missing code in
        `starchcluster.gnu_parallel <starchcluster>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} script, where the final collation step was missing.
    -   The `vcf2bed` script now accepts the `--do-not-split` option,
        which prints one BED element for all alternate alleles.
-   `Starch <starch_specification>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    archival format and compression/extraction tools
    -   Added duplicate- and
        `nested-element <nested_elements>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        flags in v2.1 of Starch metadata, which denote if a chromosome
        contains one or more duplicate and/or nested elements. BED files
        compressed with `starch` v2.5 or greater, or Starch archives
        updated with `starchcat` v2.5 or greater will include these
        values in the archive metadata. The `unstarch` extraction tool
        offers `--has-duplicate` and `--has-nested` options to retrieve
        these flag values for a specified chromosome (or for all
        chromosomes).
    -   Added `--is-starch` option to `unstarch` to test if specified
        input file is a Starch v1 or v2 archive.
    -   Added bug fix for compressing BED files with `starch`, where the
        archive would not include the last element of the BED input, if
        the BED input lacked a trailing newline. The compression tools
        now include a routine for capturing the last line, if there is
        no newline.
-   Documentation improvements
    -   Remade some image assets throughout the documents to support
        Retina-grade displays

## v2.4.2

Released: **April 10, 2014**

-   `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   Added support for `sort-bed --tmpdir` option to conversion
        scripts, to allow specification of alternative temporary
        directory for sorted results when used in conjunction with
        `--max-mem` option.
    -   Added support for GFF3 files which include a FASTA directive in
        `gff2bed` and `gff2starch` (thanks to Keith Hughitt).
    -   Extended support for Python-based conversion scripts to support
        use with Python v2.6.2 and forwards, except for `sam2bed` and
        `sam2starch`, which still require Python v2.7 or greater (and
        under Python3).
    -   Fixed `--insertions` option in `vcf2bed` to now report a
        single-base BED element (thanks to Matt Maurano).

## v2.4.1

Released: **February 26, 2014**

-   `bedmap`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--fraction-both` and `--exact` (`--fraction-both 1`) to
        list of compatible overlap options with `--faster`.
    -   Added 5% performance improvement with `bedmap` operations
        without `--faster`.
    -   Fixed scenario that can yield incorrect results (cf. [Issue
        43](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/43)).
-   `sort-bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added `--tmpdir` option to allow specification of an alternative
        temporary directory, when used in conjunction with `--max-mem`
        option. This is useful if the host operating system\'s standard
        temporary directory (*e.g.*, `/tmp` on Linux or OS X) does not
        have sufficient space to hold intermediate results.
-   All `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   Improvements to error handling in Python-based conversion
        scripts, in the case where no input is specified.
    -   Fixed typos in `gff2bed` and `psl2bed` documentation (cf.
        [commit
        a091e18](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/commit/a091e18)).
-   OS X compilation improvements
    -   We have completed changes to the OS X build process for the
        remaining half of the BEDOPS binaries, which now allows direct,
        full compilation with Clang/LLVM (part of the Apple Xcode
        distribution).

        All OS X BEDOPS binaries now use Apple\'s system-level C++
        library, instead of GNU\'s `libstdc++`. It is no longer required
        (or recommended) to use GNU `gcc` to compile BEDOPS on OS X.

        Compilation is faster and simpler, and we can reduce the size
        and complexity of Mac OS X builds and installer packages. By
        using Apple\'s C++ library, we also eliminate the likelihood of
        missing library errors.

        In the longer term, this gets us closer to moving BEDOPS to
        using the CMake build system, to further abstract and simplify
        the build process.
-   Cleaned up various compilation warnings found with `clang` /
    `clang++` and GCC kits.

## v2.4.0

Released: **January 9, 2014**

-   `bedmap`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Added new `--echo-map-size` and `--echo-overlap-size` options to
        calculate sizes of mapped elements and overlaps between mapped
        and reference elements.
    -   Improved performance for all `--echo-map-*` operations.
    -   Updated documentation.
-   Major enhancements and fixes to `sort-bed`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}:
    -   Improved performance.
    -   Fixed memory leak.
    -   Added support for millions of distinct chromosomes.
    -   Improved internal estimation of memory usage with `--max-mem`
        option.
-   Added support for compilation on Cygwin (64-bit). Refer to the
    `installation documentation <installation_via_source_code_on_cygwin>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"} for build instructions.
-   `starchcat`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed embarassing buffer overflow condition that caused
        segmentation faults on Ubuntu 13.
-   All `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   Python-based scripts no longer use temporary files, which
        reduces file I/O and improves performance. This change also
        reduces the need for large amounts of free space in a user\'s
        `/tmp` folder, particularly relevant for users converting
        multi-GB BAM files.
    -   We now test for ability to locate `starch`, `sort-bed`,
        `wig2bed_bin` and `samtools` in user environment, quitting with
        the appropriate error state if the dependencies cannot be found.
    -   Improved documentation. In particular, we have added descriptive
        tables to each script\'s documentation page which describe how
        columns map from original data input to BED output.
    -   `bam2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
        `sam2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Added `--custom-tags <value>` command-line option to support
            a comma-separated list of custom tags (cf. [Biostars
            discussion](http://www.biostars.org/p/87062/)), *i.e.*, tags
            which are not part of the original SAMtools specification.
        -   Added `--keep-header` option to preserve header and metadata
            as BED elements that use `_header` as the chromosome name.
            This now makes these conversion scripts fully \"non-lossy\".
    -   `vcf2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Added new `--snvs`, `--insertions` and `--deletions` options
            that filter VCF variants into three separate subcategories.
        -   Added `--keep-header` option to preserve header and metadata
            as BED elements that use `_header` as the chromosome name.
            This now makes these conversion scripts fully \"non-lossy\".
    -   `gff2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Added `--keep-header` option to preserve header and metadata
            as BED elements that use `_header` as the chromosome name.
            This now makes these conversion scripts fully \"non-lossy\".
    -   `psl2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Added `--keep-header` option to preserve header and metadata
            as BED elements that use `_header` as the chromosome name.
            This now makes these conversion scripts fully \"non-lossy\".
    -   `wig2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        -   Added `--keep-header` option to `wig2bed` binary and
            `wig2bed` / `wig2starch` wrapper scripts, to preserve header
            and metadata as BED elements that use `_header` as the
            chromosome name. This now makes these conversion scripts
            fully \"non-lossy\".
-   Added OS X uninstaller project to allow end user to more easily
    remove BEDOPS tools from this platform.
-   Cleaned up various compilation warnings found with `clang` /
    `clang++` and GCC kits.

## v2.3.0

Released: **October 2, 2013**

-   Migration of BEDOPS code and documentation from Google Code to
    Github.
    -   Due to changes with Google Code hosting policies at the end of
        the year, we have decided to change our process for distributing
        code, packages and documentation. While most of the work is
        done, we appreciate feedback on any problems you may encounter.
        Please email us at <bedops@stamlab.org> with details.
    -   Migration to Github should facilitate requests for code by those
        who are familiar with `git` and want to fork our project to
        submit [pull
        requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
-   `bedops`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   General `--ec` performance improvements.
-   `bedmap`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Adds support for the new `--skip-unmapped` option, which filters
        out reference elements which do not have mapped elements
        associated with them. See the end of the
        `score operations <bedmap_score_operations>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} section of the `bedmap`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} documentation for more detail.
    -   General `--ec` performance improvements.
-   `starch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed bug with `starch` where zero-byte BED input (*i.e.*, an
        \"empty set\") created a truncated and unusable archive. We now
        put in a \"dummy\" chromosome for zero-byte input, which
        `unstarch` can now unpack.

        This should simplify error handling with certain pipelines,
        specifically where set or other BEDOPS operations yield an
        \"empty set\" BED file that is subsequently compressed with
        `starch`.
-   `unstarch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Can now unpack zero-byte (\"empty set\") compressed `starch`
        archive (see above).
    -   Changed `unstarch --list` option to print to `stdout` stream
        (this was previously sent to `stderr`).
-   `starch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} metadata library
    -   Fixed array overflow bug with BEDOPS tools that take
        `starch <starch_specification>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        archives as inputs, which affected use of archives as inputs to
        `closest-features`, `bedops` and `bedmap`.
-   All `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   Python scripts require v2.7+ or greater.
    -   Improved (more \"Pythonic\") error code handling.
    -   Disabled support for `--max-mem` sort parameter until
        `sort-bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
        [issue](https://github.com/bedops/bedops/issues/1) is resolved.
        Scripts will continue to sort, but they will be limited to
        available system memory. If you are processing files larger than
        system memory, please contact us at <bedops@stamlab.org> for
        details of a temporary workaround.
-   `gff2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} conversion script
    -   Resolved `IndexError` exceptions by fixing header support,
        bringing script in line with [v1.21 GFF3
        spec](http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml).
-   `bam2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    `sam2bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} conversion scripts
    -   Rewritten `bam2*` and `sam2*` scripts from `bash` into Python
        (v2.7+ support).
    -   Improved BAM and SAM input validation against the [v1.4 SAM
        spec](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/SAMv1.pdf).
    -   New `--split` option prints reads with `N` CIGAR operations as
        separated BED elements.
    -   New `--all-reads` option prints all reads, mapped and unmapped.
-   `bedextract`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Fixed `stdin` bug with `bedextract`.
-   New documentation via [readthedocs.org](readthedocs.org).
    -   Documentation is now part of the BEDOPS distribution, instead of
        being a separate download.
    -   We use [readthedocs.org](readthedocs.org) to host indexed and
        searchable HTML.
    -   [PDF and
        eBook](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bedops/downloads/)
        documents are also available for download.
    -   Documentation is refreshed and simplified, with new installation
        and compilation guides.
-   OS X compilation improvements
    -   We have made changes to the OS X build process for half of the
        BEDOPS binaries, which allows direct compilation with Clang/LLVM
        (part of the Apple Xcode distribution). Those binaries now use
        Apple\'s system-level C++ library, instead of GNU\'s
        `libstdc++`.

        This change means that we require Mac OS X 10.7 (\"Lion\") or
        greater --- we do not support 10.6 at this time.

        Compilation is faster and simpler, and we can reduce the size
        and complexity of Mac OS X builds and installer packages. By
        using Apple\'s C++ library, we also reduce the likelihood of
        missing library errors. When this process is completed for the
        remaining binaries, it will no longer be necessary to install
        GCC 4.7+ (by way of MacPorts or other package managers) in order
        to build BEDOPS on OS X, nor will we have to bundle `libstdc++`
        with the installer.

## v2.2.0b

-   Fixed bug with OS X installer\'s post-installation scripts.

## v2.2.0

Released: **May 22, 2013**

-   Updated packages
    -   Precompiled packages are now available for Linux (32- and
        64-bit) and Mac OS X 10.6-10.8 (32- and 64-bit) hosts.
-   `Starch v2 test suite <starch_specification>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   We have added a test suite for the Starch archive toolkit with
        the source download. Test inputs include randomized BED data
        generated from chromosome and bounds data stored on UCSC servers
        as well as static FIMO search results. Tests put `starch`,
        `unstarch` and `starchcat` through various usage scenarios.
        Please refer to the Starch-specific Makefiles and the test
        target and subfolder\'s [README]{.title-ref} doc for more
        information.
-   `starchcat`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolves bug with `--gzip` option, allowing updates of `gzip`
        -backed v1.2 and v1.5 archives to the
        `v2 Starch format <starch_specification>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} (either `bzip2` - or `gzip` -backed).
-   `unstarch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolves bug with extraction of
        `Starch <starch>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} archive made
        from BED files with four or more columns. A condition where the
        total length of additional columns exceeds a certain number of
        characters would result in extracted data in those columns being
        cut off. As an example, this could affect Starch archives made
        from the raw, uncut output of GTF- and GFF-
        `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"}.
-   `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   We have partially reverted `wig2bed`, providing a Bash shell
        wrapper to the original C binary. This preserves consistency of
        command-line options across the conversion suite, while making
        use of the C binary to recover performance lost from the
        Python-based v2.1 revision of `wig2bed` (which at this time is
        no longer supported). (Thanks to Matt Maurano for reporting this
        issue.)

## v2.1.1

Released: **May 3, 2013**

-   `bedmap`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Major performance improvements made in v2.1.1, such that current
        `bedmap` now operates as fast or faster than the v1.2.5 version
        of `bedmap`!
-   `bedops`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Resolves bug with `--partition` option.
-   `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   All v2.1.0 Python-based scripts now include fix for `SIGPIPE`
        handling, such that use of `head` or other common UNIX utilities
        to process buffered standard output no longer yields `IOError`
        exceptions. (Thanks to Matt Maurano for reporting this bug.)
-   32-bit Linux binary support
    -   Pre-built Linux binaries are now available for end users with
        32-bit workstations.

Other issues fixed:

-   Jansson tarball no longer includes already-compiled libraries that
    could potentially interfere with 32-bit builds.
-   Minor changes to conversion script test suite to exit with useful
    error code on successful completion of test.

## v2.1.0

Released: **April 22, 2013**

-   `bedops`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   New `--partition` operator efficiently generates disjoint
        segments made from genomic boundaries of all overlapping inputs.
-   `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   All scripts now use `sort-bed` behind the scenes to output
        sorted BED output, ready for use with BEDOPS utilities. It is no
        longer necessary to pipe data to or otherwise post-process
        converted data with `sort-bed`.
    -   New `psl2bed` conversion script, converting [PSL-formatted UCSC
        BLAT output](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format2)
        to BED.
    -   New `wig2bed` conversion script written in Python.
    -   New `*2starch`
        `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
        role="ref"} offered for all `*2bed` scripts, which output Starch
        v2 archives.
-   `closest-features`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Replaced `--shortest` option name with `--closest`, for clarity.
        (Old scripts which use `--shortest` will continue to work with
        the deprecated option name for now. We advise editing pipelines,
        as needed.)
-   `starch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Improved error checking for interleaved records. This also makes
        use of `*2starch` conversion scripts with the `--do-not-sort`
        option safer.
-   Improved Mac OS X support
    -   New Mac OS X package installer makes installation of BEDOPS
        binaries and scripts very easy for OS X 10.6 - 10.8 hosts.
    -   Installer resolves fatal library errors seen by some end users
        of older OS X BEDOPS releases.

## v2.0.0b

Released: **February 19, 2013**

-   Added `starchcluster` script variant which supports task
    distribution with [GNU
    Parallel](http://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/).
-   Fixed minor problem with `bam2bed` and `sam2bed` conversion scripts.

## v2.0.0a

Released: **February 7, 2013**

-   `bedmap`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Takes in Starch-formatted archives as input, as well as raw BED
        (i.e., it is no longer required to extract a Starch archive to
        an intermediate, temporary file or named pipe before applying
        operations).
    -   New `--chrom` operator jumps to and operates on information for
        specified chromosome only.
    -   New `--echo-map-id-uniq` operator lists unique IDs from
        overlapping mapping elements.
    -   New `--max-element` and `--min-element` operators return the
        highest or lowest scoring overlapping map element.
-   `bedops`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Takes in Starch-formatted archives as input, as well as raw BED.
    -   New `--chrom` operator jumps to and operates on information for
        specified chromosome only.
-   `closest-features`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   Takes in Starch-formatted archives as input, as well as raw BED.
    -   New `--chrom` operator jumps to and operates on information for
        specified chromosome only.
-   `sort-bed`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and `bbms`
    -   New `--max-mem` option to limit system memory on large BED
        inputs.
    -   Incorporated `bbms` functionality into `sort-bed` with use of
        `--max-mem` operator.
-   `starch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"},
    `starchcat`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
    `unstarch`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
    -   New metadata enhancements to Starch-format archival and
        extraction, including: `--note`, `--elements`, `--bases`,
        `--bases-uniq`, `--list-chromosomes`, `--archive-timestamp`,
        `--archive-type` and `--archive-version` (see `--help` to
        `starch`, `starchcat` and `unstarch` binaries, or view the
        documentation for these applications for more detail).
    -   Adds 20-35% performance boost to creating Starch archives with
        `starch` utility.
    -   New documentation with technical overview of the Starch format
        specification.
-   `conversion scripts <conversion_scripts>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}
    -   New `gtf2bed` conversion script, converting GTF (v2.2) to BED.
-   Scripts are now part of main download; it is no longer necessary to
    download the BEDOPS companion separately.

## v1.2.5b

Released: **January 14, 2013**

-   Adds support for Apple 32- and 64-bit Intel hardware running OS X
    10.5 through 10.8.
-   Adds `README` for companion download.
-   Removes some obsolete code.

## v1.2.5

Released: **October 13, 2012**

-   Fixed unusual bug with `unstarch`, where an extra (and incorrect)
    line of BED data can potentially be extracted from an archive.
-   Updated companion download with updated `bam2bed` and `sam2bed`
    conversion scripts to address 0-indexing error with previous
    revisions.

## v1.2.3

Released: **August 17, 2012**

-   Added `--indicator` option to `bedmap`.
-   Assorted changes to conversion scripts and associated companion
    download.

    BEDOPS is a suite of tools to address common questions raised in 
    genomic studies â€” mostly with regard to overlap and proximity 
    relationships between data sets. It aims to be scalable and flexible, 
    facilitating the efficient and accurate analysis and management of 
    large-scale genomic data.

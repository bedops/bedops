.. _starch_diff:

`starch-diff`
=============

This tool allows the end user to quickly compare the compressed chromosomes in two or more v2.2+ Starch archives.

==================
Inputs and outputs
==================

-----
Input
-----

The `starch-diff` utility takes in two or more Starch v2.2+ archives as input. The end user may also add `--chr <chr>` to compare one chromosome directly; otherwise, all chromosomes in specified archives are compared.

------
Output
------

The typical output of `starch-diff` is a message indicating the archives' chromosome(s) are identical or dissimilar. 

In addition, if the chromosomes are identical, `starch-diff` exits with a zero status code. Likewise, if any chromosomes are dissimilar, `starch-diff` exits with a non-zero status code.

============
Requirements
============

If the user passes in a pre-v2.2 archive, the utility will exit with a fatal error.

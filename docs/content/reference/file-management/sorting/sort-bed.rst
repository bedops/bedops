`sort-bed`
==========

The ``sort-bed`` utility sorts BED files of any size, even larger than system memory. BED files that are in lexicographic-chromosome order allow BEDOPS utilities to work efficiently with data from any species without software modifications. Further, sorted files can be traversed very quickly.

Sorted BED order is defined first by lexicographic chromosome order, then ascending integer start coordinate order, and finally by ascending integer end coordinate order.

Other utilities in the BEDOPS suite require data in sorted order as described. You only need to sort once: BEDOPS utilities all read and write data in sorted order.

==================
Inputs and outputs
==================

-----
Input
-----

The :ref:`sort-bed` utility requires one or more three-column BED file(s). Support for common headers (such as `UCSC BED track headers <http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1>`_) is included, although headers will be stripped from the output.

------
Output
------

The :ref:`sort-bed` utility sends lexicographically-sorted BED data to standard output, which can be redirected to a file or piped to other utilities, including core BEDOPS utilities like :ref:`bedops` and :ref:`bedmap`.

=====
Usage
=====

The ``--help`` option is fairly basic, but describes the usage:

::

  sort-bed
    citation: http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/14/1919.abstract
    version:  2.4.16
    authors:  Scott Kuehn

  USAGE: sort-bed [--help] [--version] [--check-sort] [--max-mem <val>] [--tmpdir <path>] <file1.bed> <file2.bed> <...>
          Sort BED file(s).
          May use '-' to indicate stdin.
          Results are sent to stdout.

          <val> for --max-mem may be 8G, 8000M, or 8000000000 to specify 8 GB of memory.
          --tmpdir is useful only with --max-mem.

A simple example of using :ref:`sort-bed` would be:

::

  $ sort-bed unsortedData.bed > sortedData.bed

The :ref:`sort-bed` program efficiently sorts BED inputs. By default, all input records are read into system memory and sorted. If your BED dataset is larger than available system memory, use the ``--max-mem`` option to limit the amount of memory :ref:`sort-bed` uses to do its work:

::

  $ sort-bed --max-mem 2G reallyHugeUnsortedData.bed > reallyHugeSortedData.bed

This option allows :ref:`sort-bed` to scale to input of any size.

The ``--tmpdir`` option allows specification of an alternative temporary directory, when used in conjunction with ``--max-mem`` option. This is useful if the host operating systemâ€™s standard temporary directory (*e.g.*, ``/tmp`` on Linux or OS X) does not have sufficient space to hold intermediate results.

For example, to use the current working directory to store temporary data, one could use the ``$PWD`` environment variable:

::

  $ sort-bed --max-mem 2G --tmpdir $PWD reallyHugeUnsortedData.bed > reallyHugeSortedData.bed

Use of the ``--check-sort`` option returns a message if the input is sorted, or not.
